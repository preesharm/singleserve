<h2> About Black Tea </h2>

<section id="text">
<p>While black teas are made from the same Camellia sinensis plant as all teas, the oxidation and processing is what distinguishes black teas from the rest. Premium black teas are withered, rolled, oxidized and fired in an oven, creating a warm and toasty flavor. The lengthier oxidation process causes the tea leaves to develop into dark brown and black colors. The flavors can range from malty or smokey to fruity and sweet. Black teas range from mellow teas from China to full-bodied teas from Assam, India.</p>

<p>The most common perception of black tea as something that puckers our mouths, requiring milk and sugar to soften and soothe it, comes from black tea leaves grown in South Asia. Despite the ancient origins of white and green teas in China, black tea is a fairly new discovery, with beginnings dating back to only the 1700's. The Chinese traditionally give a more mellow flavor, compared to the British Legacy Teas, with which the black tea flavor profile is most commonly associated. These varieties, including Darjeeling and Ceylon, are grown, oxidized, and rolled across India.</p>
